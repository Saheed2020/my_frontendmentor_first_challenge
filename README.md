# my_frontendmentor_first_challenge
This challenge was about creating an Order summary page.
Overview
## Using HTML and CSS, I was required to create an Order Summary page.
HTML
I created three files in the project folder index.html, style.css and mobile.css for the HTML markup, main CSS styling and Mobile styling respectively.
The background Image, and the page background images were given in the challenge file and the respective color codes in HSL form. 
##Work flow
I completed the desktop version and ensured it worked before moving to the mobile version.
I broke the container into top and bottom containers, the top for the kind of Showcase image and the bottom for the contents
##Main Challeng was figuring which (flex or grid) was the best to use in arranging the items in the bottom container check-out. I eventually settled for the grid.
#HTML code:
<div class="container1">
    <!-- the showcase -->
    <div class="top-container">
      <img src="/images/illustration-hero.svg" alt="">      
    </div>
    <!-- the main part -->
    <div class="bottom-container">
      <h3>Order Summary</h3>
      <p class="text-muted">You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks and     podcasts on any device anywhere you like!</p>
      <div class="check-out">
        <div class="check-layout">
          <img class="mr-2" src="/images/icon-music.svg" alt="icon-music">
          <div id="annual">
            <h3 class="min-text">Annaul plan</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">$59.99/year</p>
          </div>
        </div>
          <a href="#">Change</a>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn-prim"> Proceed to Payment</button>
      <a href="#" >Cancel order</a>

    </div>
  </div>
</body>
Users are able to see the hover state for interactive elements: button and the links

The following pictures were taken using a phone camera to show the hover state which the screenshot of the this machine couldn't capture for some reason.
